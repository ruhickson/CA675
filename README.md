    * Load the data to PIG and structure, and filter the dataset to provide the data only for 2017
    
    * Load to the created database in the HIVE. Leaving the option to use database or generate cleaned .csv file (not decided).
    
    * Use Google Geo Charts to to visualize the data, which requires APIâ€™s and configuration of pointing to the map using longitude and latitude.
